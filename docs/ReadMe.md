## **Application Overview**

A web app for reviewing test results and overall progress of a data migration project (Healthcare).  
This app picks up test result files which are generated by LinqPad (C#, Linq) and displays a summary dashboard of key metrics.

There are three types of test results, each handled by different teams within the project:  

- **Validations**  
  Check the validity of enumerated codes used in the migrated data against code tables in the target system  

- **Referentials**  
  Check the referential integrity between the records of related entities in the migrated data  

- **Clinics**  
  Check the degree of correlation between Outpatient booking records in the migrated data and configured Outpatient Clinics in the target system

- animated panel opening for narrative text
- link to details page

#### Linqpad Test Result Details Pages  

- common layout and code for all three measure areas
- display latest test results
- previous tests can be selected from a side panel file list
- text search across all loaded results

#### Results file list with list limiter  

- file list initially displays only most recent results (as configured for the measure)
- file list expands, when requested, to show older results
- file list shows ellipsis for tests on the same date (implicit grouping)
- narrow (custom) scrollbar

#### Search  

- search terms entered are reactively evaluated against the currently displayed test result
- matches in the current display are high-lighted in yellow
- evaluation is delayed with debounce of 400ms
- search indicator badge in the results header shows match count
- search button conducts global search in all loaded results
- global search displays modal of result files with match

## **Architecture**

This app is built with Angular v5, bootstrap, angular-redux/store, and d3.  
Testing consists of unit tests, e2e tests via karma/protractor and also a suite of **Cypress.io** integration tests for comparison.

## **How to use**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

#### Demo

A demo of the application is hosted on Firebase at [Migration Workbench](https://migrationworkbench.firebaseapp.com)

#### Local installation  

Download from Github and run **yarn** to install npm dependencies.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

#### Running Cypress integration tests

The Cypress tests are packaged separately from the main application, because Cypress installs a lot of npm dependencies and adds considerable time to npm changes within the application itself.

To run Cypress tests,  

- run `ng serve` to serve the application from the local dev server.
- cd into the '/tests' sub-folder. This folder has it's own package.json with it's own scripts.
- run `npm run cypress:open` to start the Cypress test runner.
